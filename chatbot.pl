% Summer Camp Chatbot State Machine in Prolog
% This file serves as documentation of a prolog version of the automata.
% It defines states, transitions, and responses used in the chatbot.

% Define state transitions.
% Format: transition(CurrentState, NextState, InputNumber)
% Input numbers: 0, 1, 2 (corresponding to options shown at each state)
transition(a, b, 0). % Start -> Activities
transition(a, c, 1). % Start -> Costs
transition(a, d, 2). % Start -> Registration
transition(a, l, _). % Error

transition(b, f, 0). % Activities -> Location
transition(b, i, 1). % Activities -> Details
transition(b, a, 2). % Activities -> Start
transition(b, l, _). % Error

transition(c, a, 0). % Costs -> Start
transition(c, l, _). % Error

transition(d, a, 0). % Registration -> Start 
transition(d, l, _). % Error

transition(f, g, 0). % Location -> Safety
transition(f, h, 1). % Location -> Maps
transition(f, b, 2). % Location -> Activities
transition(f, l, _). % Error

transition(g, a, 0). % Safety -> Start
transition(g, l, _). % Error

transition(h, a, 0). % Maps -> Start
transition(h, l, _). % Error

transition(i, j, 0). % Details -> Age
transition(i, k, 1). % Details -> Meals
transition(i, b, 2). % Details -> Activities
transition(i, l, _). % Error

transition(j, a, 0). % Age -> Start
transition(j, l, _). % Error

transition(k, a, 0). % Meals -> Start
transition(k, l, _). % Error

transition(l, a, 0). % Error -> Start
transition(l, l, _). % Error -> Stay in error

% Define responses for each transition.
